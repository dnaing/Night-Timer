# Night Timer

Welcome to the Night Timer mobile application! This is a dedicated android application made for setting a timer, that upon completion, stops all other audio sources currently playing on your device.

In order to see how this can be useful, imagine this scenario. You are someone who likes to fall asleep whilst listening to music, or maybe even to a podcast. After you fall asleep, your device would continue to play whatever audio source you had open. 

**This is bad for three reasons.**

1. The sounds that you have playing may cause you to wake up and interrupt an otherwise good sleep session. 
2. Your device's battery is constantly getting drained unnecessarily. 
3. If you were listening to a long video or podcast, you would wake up and not have any clue as to where you were in the video when you fell asleep.

**Night Timer helps resolve all three of these issues**

1. No more sounds would be played after the timer has completed, lowering the risk that you may be woken up
2. Your device would no longer be spending battery wastefully on playing whatever audio source you had open
3. You would have a better idea of where you were in your video or podcast, because it would be within the time limit that you had set

## Usage
Unfortunately this application is not publicly available on the Google Play Store and there are no future plans to do so at this time. However, this app will still be usable via local installation
